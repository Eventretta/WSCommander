# WSCommander
WebSocket Backdoor for running commands using WebSocket (EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY)

## How does it work?

Using a website you can inject WebSocket commands and run commands. There is 1 playground only right now (inject code) but you will be able to do more stuff later

# DISCLAIMER

This is only, and only for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, i did it for fun!

# SECURITY
To secure this from hacking, to access your PC you need the key outputted by your Server. Otherwise it will not receive commands. People can see if someone tried to inject something but didn't have the Commander key.
